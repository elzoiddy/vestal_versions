HEAD
* Added global configuration option to use another for the number column in versions table
  "number" is a reserved word in oracle and cannot be used as a column name or table. 
  Default is still number, since it works fine in most other databases
* Added an option in versioned to specify version change comments as being 
  :update_comments => <:none|:optional|:required>

  :none will not record a reason for update even it's given.  
  :optional will record your reason for update if one is provided
  :required requires you to provide a reason for updating or record will be valid
    and an exception will be thrown if you skip validation.

  Note: this validation for reason_for_update to be present is skipped when
  we create a new version and the initial_version flag is turned off. 

* Added a new class level 'skip_version' that works on one model at
a time
* Internal refactoring and tidying up by Alex Crichton
